# DigitsRecognition
Digits (Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits)  Introduced by Alpaydin et al. in Optical recognition of handwritten digits data set. The DIGITS dataset consists of 1797 8Ã—8 grayscale images (1439 for training and 360 for testing) of handwritten digits.

The Chars74K dataset is a specialized collection aimed at enhancing research in numeric character recognition. It encompasses a total of over 74,000 images, drawn from three distinct sources: 7,705 digits extracted from natural scenes, 3,410 digits hand-drawn using a tablet PC, and 62,992 digits synthesized from computer fonts. This dataset is organized into 10 classes, corresponding to the Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 through 9.

Crafted to support the development and testing of numeric recognition algorithms, the Chars74K dataset serves as a pivotal resource for tackling the complexities of digit recognition in varied contexts. Despite the high accuracy of character recognition systems in controlled settings, such as document scans with uniform fonts and backgrounds, the task remains challenging in less constrained environments captured by everyday photography and devices.

Introduced by T. E. de Campos, B. R. Babu, and M. Varma in their research on numeric character recognition in natural images at the International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP) in Lisbon, Portugal, in February 2009, the Chars74K dataset is designed to address these real-world challenges. By providing a diverse array of digit images, it enables researchers and technologists to refine and advance the capabilities of automatic number recognition systems, ensuring they are robust and effective across a wide range of applications.
